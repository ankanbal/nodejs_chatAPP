# nodejs_chatAPP
A simple easy to build chat application created using nodejs
Install these first in order to run these:-
1. socket.io for the actual chat connection
2. express.js since I created the app on that
3. nodemon since this will directly reload the program after you make any changes to it (saving you the trouble of self loading it everytime)

How to run:- Just download the project, go to the folder, start terminal and type nodemon app.js
              after that, just go to browser and type localhost:3000 (on same pc) or (ip address of pc running the program without brackets):3000
              enter your name and start chatting, since it will be a group chat so any number of people can join.

Update:- Successfully done the registration part (now registereed users can only chat)

PS:- Currently working on the UI for this so the appearance is subject to change. Depending on what additional functionalities I add will decide what kind of particular application I want to create.
