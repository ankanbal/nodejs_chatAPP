# nodejs_chatAPP
A simple easy to build chat application created using nodejs
Install these first in order to run these:-
1. socket.io for the actual chat connection
2. express.js since I created the app on that
3. nodemon since this will directly reload the program after you make any changes to it (saving you the trouble of self loading it everytime)

Update:- Successfully done the registration part (now registereed users can only chat)//
PS:- Currently working on the UI for this so the appearance is subject to change. Depending on what additional functionalities I add will decide what kind of particular application I want to create.
